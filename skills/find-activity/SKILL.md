# Find the right business activity

Explicit user instructions take priority over this workflow.

1. `search_activities` with the business in plain words; narrow with `lane`
   (ifza, afz, ded) if the user has a route in mind.
2. `get_activity` for the candidates: the authority's own description, each
   lane's activity code and licence type, facility and approval requirements,
   and documents.
3. Report the best matches with what each covers in the authority's words.
   A match is a candidate scope, not a confirmed one; the authority confirms
   the final activity. If nothing matches well, say so rather than stretching
   a near match.
4. Regulated financial services, crypto and construction are not covered;
   point the user to the regulator.
