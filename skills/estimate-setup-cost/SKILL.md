# Estimate a UAE setup cost

Explicit user instructions take priority over this workflow.

1. **IFZA:** `estimate_ifza_setup` with the visas (title, and whether the person
   is already in the UAE) and licence term; `estimate_ifza_five_year` for the
   longer view.
2. **Dubai mainland:** `get_mainland`, then `estimate_mainland_licence` for one
   of the six covered activities with one or two owners and the annual rent.
3. **Any other free zone:** `get_free_zone` and its published packages. No
   estimator covers it; say so.

Rules:

- Report `pricedSubtotalAed` with its unresolved lines and exclusions beside
  it. `selectedTotalAed` is null when anything is unknown, and full totals are
  always null — never add one up yourself.
- The mainland figure is licence fees only. The rent assessment is not the
  rent; rent, visas, approvals and renewal are separate.
- If an estimator refuses a scenario, report the refusal. Do not extrapolate.
- These are dated reference figures, not quotes. Give the date and cite the page.
